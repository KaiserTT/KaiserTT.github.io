**Scarity**: the limited nature of society's resources

**Economics**: the study of how society  manages its scarce resources

**Efficiency**: the property of society getting the most it can from its scarce resources

**Equality**: the property of distributing economic prosperity uniformly among the members of society

**Opportunity Cost**: whatever must be given up to obtain some items

**Rational People**: people who systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives

**Marginal Change**: a small incremental adjustment to a plan of action

**Incentive**: something that induces a people to act

**Market Economy**: an economy that allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in the markets for goods and services

**Property Rights**: the ability of an individual to own and exercise control over scarce resources

**Market Failure**: a situation in which a market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently

**Externality**: the impact of one person's action on the well-being of a bystander

**Market Power**: the ability of a single economic actor (or small group of actors) to have a substantial influences on market prices 

**Productivity**: the quantity of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input

**Inflation**: an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy

**Business Cycle**: fluctuations in economic activity, such as employment and production



## How People Make Decisions



### Principle 1: People Face Trade-offs

trade-offs: 

- how students spend their time
- how parents decide to spend their family income
- guns and butter
- a clean environment and a high level of income
- efficiency and equality



### Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It

the decision to go to college

- obvious cost: tuition, books, room and board
- not obvious cost: time and the earnings they give up to attend school

opportunity cost



### Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin 

Economists normally assume that people are rational. 

**Rational people** know that decisions in life are rarely black and white but often involve shades of gray.

Economists use the term **marginal change** to describe a small incremental adjustment to an existing plan of action. 

Rational people make decisions by comparing **marginal benefits** and **marginal costs**.

examples:

- movie streaming service
- airline charge passengers
- cheap water and expensive diamonds

A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the action’s marginal benefit exceeds its marginal cost.



### Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives 

 “People respond to incentives. The rest is commentary.”

- market
- policy making
- How does a seat belt law affect auto safety? 



## How People Interact 



### Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off

- competition between countries



### Principle 6: Markets Are Usually  Good Way to Organize Economic Activity

In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, economist Adam Smith made the most famous observation in all of economics: Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by an “invisible hand” that leads them to desirable market outcomes. 



### Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes

One reason we need government is that the invisible hand can work its magic only if the government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are key to a market economy. Most important, market economies need institutions to enforce 
**property rights** so individuals can own and control scarce resources. 

Another reason we need government is that, although the invisible hand is powerful, it is not omnipotent. 

- promote efficiency 
- promote equality

the goal of efficiency

- market failure
- externality
  - pollution
- market power



## How the Economy as a Whole Works



### Principle 8: A Country's Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability of Produce Goods and Services

 Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to differences in countries’ **productivity**.



### Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money
inflation



### Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment

While an increase in the quantity of money primarily raises prices in the long run, the short-run story is more complex. Most economists describe the short-run effects of money growth as follows:

- Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level of spending and thus the demand for goods and services.
- Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and produce a larger quantity of goods and services.
- More hiring means lower unemployment.

This short-run trade-off plays a key role in the analysis of the **business cycle**.
