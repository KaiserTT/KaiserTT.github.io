**Circular-Flow Diagram**: a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms

**Production Possibilities Frontier**: a graph that shows the combiantions of output that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available production technology 

**Microeconomics**: the study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in markets

**Macroeconomics**: the study of economywide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth 

**Absolute Advantage**: the ability to produce a good using fewer inputs than another producer

**Comparative Advantage**: the ability of produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer

## Economic Models



###  The Circular-Flow Diagram

A more complex and realistic circular-flow model would include, for instance, the roles of government and international trade.

## Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

- **Microeconomics** is the study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in specific markets.
- **Macroeconomics** is the study of economywide phenomena. 



## Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization

Economists use the term **absolute advantage** when comparing the productivity of one person, firm, or nation to that of another.

The producer that requires a smaller quantity of inputs to produce a good is said to have an absolute advantage in producing that good.

Economists use the term **comparative advantage** when describing the opportunity costs faced by two producers.

The producer who gives up less of other goods to produce Good X has the smaller opportunity cost of producing Good X and is said to have a comparative advantage in producing.

The gains from specialization and trade are based not on absolute advantage but on comparative advantage.

**Trade can benefit everyone in society because it allows people to specialize in the activities in which they have a comparative advantage.**

**For both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they trade must lie between their opportunity costs.**
